## Reflection

This was a 4 month project, and is a part of a system made in collaboration with Cordel Norge, as a bachelorproject. Goals for this applicaiton is a system for Cordel's costumers to see and interract with interesting business information.

It has been challenging working with alot of new software, and therefore posing as a very good learning experience.

This systems relies on Recharts graphing tools to genereate the graphs, aswell as Material-UI for widgets. Axios, Localstorage, react bootstrap, react router, react testing library, formik and yup are examples of packeges and libraries used in this project.

This application talks with a backend made with C# and a database made in PostgreSQL.
